# Useful things to know

To run documentation for Go programs locally, you can type: `godoc -http :8000`. If you don't have `godoc` command, you need to manually install it by typing `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc`. Godoc extracts and generates documentation for Go programs.

# Content

All programs in this repository are prepared with the Test Driven Development technique.
These programs are really small, consisting mainly of a few lines of code. They serve to give me a better understanding of basic operations in Go.

   * `hello-world` - Traditional, first program to familiarise with the basic Go syntax. 
   * `sum-numbers` - A programme that familiarises with arrays and slices.
   * `geometry` - Get to know Structs, methods & interfaces 
   * `wallet` - Bitcoin wallet simulation. Learning about pointers.
   * `greeter` - Program to learn Dependency Injection. Simply greets the user.
